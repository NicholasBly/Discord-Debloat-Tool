A very simple tool to list all of the folders inside the %localappdata% and give you the option to delete unnecessary functions of Discord to debloat it and prevent these features from running on your PC.

Folders labelled in green exist, while folders labelled in red are deleted.

Simply check the box next to the corresponding folder name to mark it for deletion, and press the "Debloat Discord" button.

TODO: Setup a task scheduler task to run daily to check for a new discord installation and delete the folders automatically.
