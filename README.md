A very simple tool to list all of the folders inside the %localappdata% Discord directory and give you the option to delete unnecessary functions of Discord to prevent these features from running on your PC.

Folders labeled in green exist, while folders labeled in red are deleted.

Simply check the box next to the corresponding folder name to mark it for deletion, and press the "Debloat Discord" button.

TODO: Set up a task scheduler task to run daily to check for a new discord installation and delete the folders automatically.

TODO: Add feature descriptions for each folder to describe them in detail via hovering over each label.
